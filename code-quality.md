+ Challenges in large projects - Code Quality
+ MISRA standards
+ Memory errors - heap issues 
+ Heap analysis - valgrind
+ At which stage we should identify violations? 
+ Development phases - preprocessing, compiling, linking, execute
+ Before compilation -- static analysis of the code by static analyzers
+ ISO 26262? Functional Safety - one of the supporting pillar is Coding Standards
+ Coding Standards? (Secure/Safe coding), e.g. MISRA -- latest version:2012,further revisons
+ Tools to ensure coding standards -- static analyzers -- conformity
+ Compiler warnings -- primary analysis(very basic)
+ Compilers:- gcc/g++, MingW gcc, visual studio etc.
+ Cppcheck, current version: 1.84
+ CodeBlocks for C/C++ development, cppcheck plugin
+ Map CodeBlocks with cppcheck plugin
+ Code can be hosted on github for submission purpose
